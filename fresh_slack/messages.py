Hey very quiet channel. We tend the channel garden by archiving channels that
have been quiet for 30 straight days and this channel is one of them. Archiving
a channel removes it from the list of active channels and prevents new comments
from being made there. That makes it easier for newer folks to find the right
place to get their questions, answers and comments heard without wading through
extraneous channels or worse, posting a comment only to hear nothing in
response. All existing comments in the channel are retained for easy browsing
and searching and can be read like any other channel. If need for this
particular channel arises again, it can be unarchived by any user here. If you'd
like to keep this channel active, SAY ANYTHING and we'll reset the timer. It's
that simple. If we don't hear from anyone in the next 30 days, this channel will
be archived.

Hello still very quiet channel. We're archiving this channel as it's been
crickets here for 60 days. Content on this channel is still available via search
and anyone can un-archive a channel if they want to dust it off. Channels are
free.Note: If you unarchive this channel, but then send no messages to it, it
will be archived again immediately. We base archival decisions based on
messages, not archival/unarchival activity.
